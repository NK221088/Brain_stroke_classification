As the dataset is relatively imbalanced I will try to supplement with synthetic data.
However, as it could also be argued that the great imbalance represent real world the synthetic data will be tested against just using the data as is.
Furthermore, the number of synthetic data points added will be treated as a hyperparameter, which can the be fine tuned in two-level cross validation.

Modelwise, I will compare a random forrest with an ANN.
For the random forrest I will fintune the following parameters:
- n_estimators
- max_depth
- min_samples_split
- min_samples_leaf

For the ANN I will finetune the following parameters:
- Number of hidden layers
- Neurons per layer
- Dropout rate
- Learning rate
